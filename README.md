# Solid-principles-examples
# 1.	Single Responsibility Principle: It states that a class should have only one responsibility.

# 2.Open-Closed Principle : Open for Extension and Closed for modification.
Example for open-closed principle is comparator for sorting.

# 3.Liskovs substitution principle : It states that subclass should be substitutable for super class.

# 4.Interface Segregation Principle : It states that larger interface segregates into smaller ones, Because the implementing classes will have to implement all the class, so we should-not force subclasses.

# 5.Dependency Inversion Principle :  This Principle states that we must use abstraction(abstract classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. High-level modules should-not depend on low-level module but both should depend on abstraction.
